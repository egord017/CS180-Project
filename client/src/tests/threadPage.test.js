//unit/component testing//////
//------------------------
//usually the steps are to 
//1. mock the input
//2. run function/or check html
//2. check expected.

//test commentslist : just make sure outputs are correct under these two cases
    //test empty
    //test input

//test threadlist : 
    //test body
    //test no body




//integration testing :
//-------------------
//more loaded. mock inputs for the form, and then submit form.
//see what is expected
//here you should test edge cases, like inputting wrong information (usualy empty).


//reply submit form
    //test a successful submission.
    //test edge case inputs, expect the proper response.
