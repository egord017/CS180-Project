Setup and Run guide:

1. Download node.js

2. Download PostgreSQL
    use this tutorial as reference:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZQI7nBu32M (its kind of a weird video tbh but its good enough)

3. Go to db.js in the server folder and replace 'YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD' with the password you set for PostgreSQL during installation

4. Open database.sql in the server folder to see all of the sql scripts

5. Open CMD and type 'psql -U postgres'

6. copy and paste 'CREATE DATABASE writersblock;' into CMD to create the SQL database
    you can use '\l' to view all of your current databases then '\c databaseName' to jump into a database

7. do 'create exenstion if not exists "uuid-ossp";' in CMD to add uuid exention to sql
    then copy and paste each CREATE TABLE statement in the database.sql to create all of the tables for the database

8. To run the server, type 'nodemon index' in your IDE console. 
    If you made code changes and want to rerun the server, hit control-s in index.js and nodemon will restart the server
